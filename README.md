<h1>Differentiator Neural Network for Image Comparison</h1>


<p>The Differentiator Neural Network is a <strong>Python-based project</strong> developed using the TensorFlow library. It is designed to accurately distinguish between two given images by leveraging the power of deep learning.</p>

<p>By training the neural network on a dataset of labeled images, it learns to identify and highlight the distinguishing features or characteristics of each input image.</p>
