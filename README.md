# Differentiator Neural Network for Image Comparison
The Differentiator Neural Network is a Python-based project developed using the TensorFlow library. It is designed to accurately distinguish between two given images by leveraging the power of deep learning. By training the neural network on a dataset of labeled images, it learns to identify and highlight the distinguishing features or characteristics of each input image.
